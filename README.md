# Abnormal Action Detection in Videos

In this project we plan to apply results concerning online action detection in videos to abnormal event spotting in real-life datasets.
Therefore we will combine the method porposed by Waqas Sultani et al.(2018) with the online setting and compare online versus offline settings results.

In this section we reproduce the results of Sultani et al.(2018). In this part we work in offline settings, and we are only interested in temporal detection.
